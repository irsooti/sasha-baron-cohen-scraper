## In preparation of the real app

For each set of eyes, choose which word best describes what the person in the picture is thinking or feeling. You may feel that more than one word is applicable, so choose the word which you consider to be the most suitable. Before making your choice, make sure that you have read all four words. Try to do the task as quickly as possible, but you will not be timed.

Which word best describes what the person in the picture is thinking and feeling?

## Understand of the score

The average score for this test is in the range of 22 to 30 correct responses. If you scored above 30, you may be quite good at understanding someone's mental state based on facial cues. If you scored below 22, you may find it difficult to understand a person's mental state based on their facial expressions.


## How to use the JSON?

Images are placed in `images` folder. Each id in the json corresponds to a jpg image:

```
/images/<uuid>.jpg
```

That's it!
